# EventifyVibe
Eventify Community - is an application that allows anyone to create and attend events that anyone can attend and register. The application is a convenient platform that brings people together based on common interests and preferences, allowing them to meet, exchange contacts and share information about themselves.

*Key features include:*

- *Create Events*: Anyone can easily create and organize their own events by providing information about the place, date, time and description of the event.
- *Participant Registration*: Anyone can view the available events and register for them right through the app.
- *Networking*: The app provides a convenient platform for participants to communicate with each other. Users can view profiles of other members, share contacts and make connections. In this way, the application allows you to create your own network of valuable contacts.
- *Profile Descriptions*: each user has the opportunity to provide a description of themselves, including information about their skills, knowledge, links to social networks and web pages, demonstrating how they can be useful to other members.
- *Event Attendance History*: Members can view their event attendance history at any time and see all the attendees who attended each particular event, allowing them to find contacts of people who can help them with their current problems or queries.

The aim of this project is to facilitate beneficial connections between companies and potential contributors by providing a platform where they can meet, communicate and interact with each other.
