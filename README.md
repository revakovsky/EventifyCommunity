# EventifyVibe
Eventify Vibe is an app that allows companies to create events where anyone interested can come and register. The app provides a convenient platform that brings people together based on common interests and preferences, enabling them to meet, exchange contacts, and share information about themselves.

---

Key features include:

- Event creation: Companies can easily create and organize their own events, providing information about the location, date, time, and event description.
- Participant registration: Anyone can browse the available events and register for them directly through the app.
- Networking: The app provides a convenient platform for participants to connect with each other. Users can view profiles of other participants, exchange contacts, and establish connections. This way, the app allows you to build your own network of valuable contacts.
- Profile descriptions: Each user has the opportunity to provide a description of themselves, including information about their skills, knowledge, links to social media, and web pages, showcasing how they can be helpful to other participants.
- Event attendance history: Participants can review their history of attended events at any time and see all the attendees present at each specific event, giving them the opportunity to find contacts of people who can assist them with their current challenges or requests.

The goal of this project is to facilitate connections between companies and potential participants by providing a platform where they can meet, communicate, and interact with each other.
